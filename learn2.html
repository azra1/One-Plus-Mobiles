Carl Pei wants you to believe in OnePlus. It’s been three years 
since this 26-year-old co-founded the company, and as he’s talking
 to me, the OnePlus 3, the company’s latest flagship, is due to
 arrive in less than a week. Things are different this go-around:
 the infamous OnePlus hype machine has been operating far
 more quietly than in prior years and the much-hated invite
 system to buy phones has been scuttled.

"We’re using a different approach for our third year," says Pei.
 "As a company grows, expectations change and we have to be
 more responsible of a company. We just couldn’t sell on an invite 
system at this point in the company’s history." The new phone
 is available direct from OnePlus starting today, without
 requiring you to jump through any hoops to buy it.

No matter how it’s sold, the OnePlus 3 might be the first affordable
 phone that truly makes good on the promise to be as great as the
 high-priced flagships from the likes of Samsung and HTC. It has 
everything we’ve come to expect from high-end Android phones — 
fast processor, premium design, capable camera, quick charging,
 a great display — but sells for just $399 unlocked. That’s about 
$300 less than you’ll pay for a Samsung Galaxy S7 or HTC 10,
 which have similar specs and features.

We’ve heard this pitch from Pei and OnePlus before: the OnePlus 2 
was billed as a "2016 flagship killer" even though it was released
 in 2015. That phone showed promise, but lacked table stakes 
features such as quick charging and NFC. Pei is much more
 realistic this year: he says the OnePlus 3 is "competitive to
 flagships of this generation in terms of specs."

Pei wants you to believe that OnePlus has learned a thing or two 
over the past few years, that it’s a more mature company and not
 just a scrappy upstart. Mostly, he wants you to believe that a young
 company like OnePlus can produce a device that’s as good as,
 if not better than, the established stalwarts in the smartphone 
industry.

After spending the past week with the OnePlus 3 in my pocket,
 I’m beginning to feel like a believer.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:150%;text-align:center;color:red;">"The OnePlus 3's design isn't wholly original, but it's
 refined and functional"</pre>

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
The fingerprint scanner below the display is fast and reliable
 — a significant improvement over the OnePlus 2’s
 — and the 3 still has the super useful switch on the 
side for toggling between Android’s three notification
 settings. It’s by far my favorite hardware feature
 on the phone and something I wish all Android 
phones came equipped with.

If you’re reading the OnePlus 3’s spec sheet, you 
might notice that its 5.5-inch 1080p display isn’t
 as high-resolution as the screens on the Galaxy S7,
 HTC 10, and other phones released this year. But if
 you didn’t look at the spec sheet and just used the phone,
 you’d be hard-pressed to notice the difference. Pei says
 it was a "conscious choice" to use a 1080p screen in 
place of a higher-resolution option, as it provides better
 performance and heat management than more
 pixel-dense screens. I’m inclined to agree: the AMOLED
 screen on the OnePlus 3 is bright, vibrant, easy to see
 outdoors, and at 401ppi, plenty sharp enough for human
 eyes. You might want something more pixel-dense for 
virtual reality, but for everything else you use a smartphone
 for, the OnePlus 3’s screen is more than sufficient.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
The next lesson OnePlus learned for the 3: don’t omit useful
 hardware features. "Our main customer base is early adopters,"
 admits Pei. "We’re shifting our thinking towards that and giving 
them what they’re asking for."

Like the OnePlus 2, the OnePlus 3 charges through a USB 
Type-C port, but this time around, it also offers quick charging.
 OnePlus calls it Dash Charging, and like competing solutions
 from Qualcomm, Samsung, and others, it can recharge most of the
 phone’s battery in just a few minutes. Pei says the 3 can get
 "a day of use from half an hour" of charging.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:150%;text-align:center;color:red;">"Quick charging and NFC both show up this year"</pre>

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
OnePlus’ charging system is a little different, however, 
as it offloads the current regulation to the charging 
brick instead of managing it in the phone. Translated,
 this means that the phone is cooler when it charges and 
you can still use it for gaming and other intensive
 activities without sacrificing fast charging speeds.
 The downside is that in order to have quick charging,
 you have to use the charger and cable that come in the
 box with the OnePlus 3 — other quick chargers or USB-C 
cables will only charge the device at standard speeds. 
OnePlus is selling a compatible car charger and additional
 wall chargers for $29.95 and $19.95, respectively.

Another feature the OnePlus 3 has over its predecessor
 is an NFC chip, and it works for anything that supports
 NFC, including Android Pay and accessories that have 
tap-to-pair features.

The OnePlus 3 isn’t an exact match for a Galaxy S7
 in terms of hardware features — it doesn’t have any 
water resistance or wireless charging — but it costs
 so much less than an S7 that I’m inclined to forgive
 those omissions. Other phones, such as the HTC 10 
and LG G5, don’t offer those features either, so it’s not
 like the OnePlus 3 is alone in not having them.

Under the hood, the OnePlus 3 is competitive with or 
better than the best Android phones you can buy today.
 Its Snapdragon 820 processor is the same chip found
 in the S7, HTC 10, and LG G5, and the 6GB of RAM 
in the OnePlus 3 is actually more than you’ll get in 
any other smartphone right now. In my experience, the
 OnePlus 3 has no performance issues or hiccups: the 
interface is fast and responsive and it handles everything 
from messaging to multitasking to gaming with ease. 
The phone comes with 64GB of storage — there are no
 options beyond that — but it doesn’t support expansion 
through microSD. Pei says that few customers bought
 the entry level OnePlus 2 that had 16GB of storage,
 so efforts were focused on the most popular model
 this time around.

The 3,000mAh battery in the OnePlus is good 
enough to keep it going for a full day of heavy use 
and the aforementioned quick charging features 
make it easy to top up when needed. Of all the phones
 I’ve used this year, the only one that does better is 
the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and that’s only
 because it has a 20 percent larger battery.

OnePlus is selling the 3 unlocked, but it’s only 
compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile, and their related 
MVNOs in the US. It does not work on Verizon or
 Sprint and likely never will — Pei says that supporting
 CDMA networks requires more engineering and 
support resources than OnePlus can devote at this
 time. The OnePlus 3 does have support for two nano 
SIM cards at the same time, which is a great feature
 if you frequently travel internationally.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
OnePlus also learned that in order to have a competitive smartphone,
 it needs to have an excellent camera, and the 16-megapixel 
camera on the OnePlus 3 is much improved over last year’s
 phone. It has an f/2.0 aperture lens, optical image
 stabilization, and 4K video capability.

Unlike last year’s phone, the camera is very fast to
 launch and fast to focus, and takes good photos in both
 good and poor lighting. It’s not as good of a camera as
 the class-leading Galaxy S7, but not being the absolute
 best doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s still good.
 Colors are accurate and images are sharp and detailed.
 My only complaint is that the camera tends to rely
 on its optical stabilization too much, extending the shutter
 speed and making it more difficult to capture moving 
subjects than it should be.

The camera app is spartan, but still offers a manual mode
 and control over things like HDR and resolution. OnePlus
 added an "HD" setting for stills, but I’m not a fan — 
it increases the sharpening to unpleasant levels and I just
 kept it off as a result.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:200%;text-align:center;color:red;">"Software updates remain an open question"</pre>

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
The open question here is: how long will it take for OnePlus
 to deliver software updates to the 3? The OnePlus 2 was
 promised to get Android Marshmallow as soon as the new
 software was announced last fall, but after months of delays,
 it only just received the update a little over a week ago. 
Pei won’t commit to an update schedule for the OnePlus 3,
 but he admits that OnePlus’ early adopter customers
 want to see fast updates. "The biggest lesson we’ve
 learned over the past few years [with software] is to
 show and not just tell," says Pei.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
With the invite system and over-the-top marketing claims a thing
 of the past, OnePlus is leaning on the strength of its product.
 Fortunately for the company, the OnePlus 3 is an incredibly strong
 product to lean on. It hits all the marks for what an Android phone 
should offer in 2016, and it does so at a price that’s 
significantly less than the competition.

The OnePlus 3 isn’t perfect: you can’t use it at all if you’re a
 Verizon or Sprint customer, and depending on your priorities,
 it might not have everything on your wish list. But it’s a
 significant step forward for OnePlus, in terms of both quality
 of the product and how you’re able to buy it. It’s also a step
 forward for the industry as a whole: it’s a device that keeps 
pace with much more expensive products while costing much less.
 The OnePlus 3 is the rare kind of phone that I can recommend 
without reservations, other from making sure it works on 
your carrier.
</pre>
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:200%;text-align:center;color:red;">"The OnePlus 3 is a significant step 
forward for the company"</pre>
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:130%;text-align:center;">
As our chat comes to an end, Pei notes that future OnePlus
 "conversation will continue to go towards the product itself"
 and the company is "confident about future products.
" If OnePlus’ future phones are as good as the OnePlus 3,
 I’ll be happy to keep talking."
