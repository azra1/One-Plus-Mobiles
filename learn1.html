Despite being considered an underdog to Samsung and Apple</b>
, OnePlus has steadily grown to become a fan favourite. The launch
 of its OnePlus 3 has only bolstered this reputation.

<a href="oneplus.html">OnePlus</a> has long been described as an 'Apple killer' and although
 it's unlikely to ever topple the Californian behemoth, its latest
 handset could steal away a large proportion of its loyal fanbase
. The <a href="oneplus3.html">OnePlus 3</a> more than lives up to the months of hype and, while
 far from perfect, earns its title as a flagship phone.

Updated 11.06.2016, 13:25: This review has been updated to reflect
 the fact WIRED has now being using the device for a month. The
 score has remained the same.</pre>

The OnePlus 3 is not only a great looking device, it feels much more
 expensive than its £309 price tag. This price was recently increased 
following the EU Referendum, but even at £329, the price is still 
fantastic. The aluminium alloy body is heavy enough to make it feel 
sturdy – a feature the iPhone doesn't have when out of a case - and 
the metal is a welcome relief from the plastic casing of other 
similarly-priced Android phones, such as the LG G4.

The OnePlus 3 also ships with a pre-installed screen protector for 
extra protection. In the month that we have been using the device,
 there have been a couple of times we have stumbled or dropped
 the device. Thankfully the screen hasn't smashed, but without a
 case on, the OnePlus 3 does feel a little fragile and can pick up
 knocks and scratches easily. And the cases the firm provides feel
 cheap and are ugly in comparison to the original casing.

It's 7.3mm thick, significantly thinner than the 9.9mm <a href="oneplus2.html">OnePlus 2</a>
, and its 5.5-inch 1080p Optic Amoled display has "one of the world's
 thinnest bezels". This incredibly thin bezel means the phone
 doesn't feel much larger than the iPhone 6S and certainly doesn't
 feel as large as the 6S Plus, despite the almost identical
 measurements.

On the downside though, the thin bezel means holding the phone
 can be difficult. We would often select menus and apps on the
 edges of the screen by accident and having to hold it as if it's
 fragile detracts away from the sturdy first impression. This
 is particularly the case when using the phone in bed, or
 while laying down for example, and we often dropped the
 phone on our face or chest attempting to hold it in such a
 way that didn't impact the screen due to this thin bezel.

The OnePlus 2 display lacked the contrast and vibrant colours seen
 on its rivals, namely Samsung’s Galaxy range, and this has been
 remedied on the OnePlus 3.

Its 5.5-inch, full HD Amoled screen features a dual-polarising layer
 which is said to "produce colours that are more vivid and true-to-life
 than ever before, even in bright sunlight" and in tests, we found
 this to be largely true. Compared to the iPhone, as well as LG's G4,
 Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge and the Nexus 6P, on the OnePlus 3
 almost all areas of the screen, and apps, were visible in bright
 sunlight – when the display brightness was set to 80 per cent
 and above.

However, when its screen was angled towards the Sun, this made it
 difficult and in some cases impossible to see what we were clicking on.
 Moving indoors, the phone's auto-adjust display setting dropped
 down to around 60 per cent and the display was still visible.
 In fact, we dropped it down to 20 per cent and could still make
 out apps and text.

As part of a recent software update, OnePlus added a so-called
 sRGB colour mode to tone down the original default colour view.
 This has battery saving potential but will make the screen appear
 more dull. You also need to enable the developer options in
 Settings to further enable this sRBG mode. The benefit, beyond 
battery life, is that colours look more realistic.

In addition to the supplied screen protector, the phone comes with
 damage resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 4. There is also an 
extremely subtle curve in this glass which makes apps, and videos
 in particular, appear to leap from the screen. This helps
 improve visibility.

There is a downside to this though. The screen resolution doesn't 
quite match up to other rival flagship phones, namely the
 Galaxy S6 and S7 range because it runs full HD, rather
 than Quad HD (1080p resolutions that measure 1920x1080
 pixels versus 2560x1440 pixels)

And while claims about brightness and clarity made by the
 company are accurate – and photos, Instagram posts and
 album artwork truly shine on the large display – the
 screen itself smudges very easily. It's also extremely
 reflective, which takes away slightly from the great 
way it handles bright light.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:verdana;font-size:400%;text-align:left;">            Camera</pre>
<input name="" type="image" src="l3.jpg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">
At the launch for its latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 3 (pictured), CEO Pete Lau
 said the company would concentrate on one "true flagship" line.

<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">
On the rear of the phone is a 16MP camera, while the front-facing
 camera has an 8MP sensor. The rear sensor significantly protrudes
 from the back of the device, especially when compared to the iPhone
 and or the Huawei P9, which prides itself on having no discernible 
'bump.' The P9 is 0.3mm thinner than the OnePlus 3 so there isn't
 any excuse.

That said, having this large sensor does mean photos look
 extremely professional. OnePlus has a host of imaging
 technologies to make taking photos easier including 
Smart Capture, which uses HD Mode, Auto HDR and 
Dynamic De-noise to reduce noise. It does this by 
comparing several frames of the same photo and 
blending them together. Users can now also take a
 selfie using the front-facing camera simply by smiling
 at the screen.

Other photography tools include Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS)
 and Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to reduce blur as well as
 a manual mode, controlled comfortably with the side buttons,
 that offers the benefits of a DSLR, including support of RAW
 image files.

<input name="" type="image" src="l4.jpg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

Rather than having options hidden in menus, the majority of the
 useful settings are accessible from the camera screen and can be
 toggled off at the press of a button. We welcomed this at first,
 but the more we used the device the more difficult we found 
it was to switch between the various modes.

The 'smiling selfie' feature on the front of the device does feel like
 a gimmick and some of our efforts made us look like we were
 grimacing. Elsewhere, when a photo is taken it doesn't
 automatically appear as a thumbnail on the camera screen
. You have to navigate away from the camera to your Gallery
 or Photos app. The fact there are two locations these photos
 can be stored in is our first complaint, and not being able to 
quickly check an image is our second.

Also, taking selfies in a group meant that the photo was taken as
 soon as the sensor registered a smile from one of the members,
 not when everyone was ready.

There are countless phones with increasingly good cameras; even
 struggling HTC excels at its sensors, so the OnePlus 3 doesn't
 stand out massively from the crowd in terms of quality, nor is
 it as easy to use as our initial tests suggested.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:verdana;font-size:400%;text-align:left;">            Software</pre>
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">
The handset runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with an OxygenOS
 skin. Unlike skins seen on other manufacturer's phones, the
 OxygenOS is much less obtrusive. Its widgets are pre-installed
 but are hidden and can be accessed with a swipe of the
 left-hand edge. This page can also be removed entirely,
 making it much less jarring than HTC's BlinkFeed.

<a href="pneplus3.html">OnePlus 3</a> is not trying to force health, productivity or other
 lifestyle apps on its users, like Samsung does for example, and it
 has a decent amount of internal storage. On the model we used,
 apps, images, videos, audio, cached data and three of our Spotify
 playlists used up just 1.94GB of the total 52.67GB. It doesn't list 
the operating system on this, but the phone is a 64GB model so
 it can be assumed a phone manufacturer is finally showing the
 true, available storage when in Settings.


<input name="" type="image" src="l5.jpg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

Although this still doesn't get around complaints about 
manufacturers over-selling storage on their phones -
 selling a 64GB phone with only 50GB available
 for example - it does make the true internal storage 
much easier to understand and transparent.

The rest of the software stays relatively true to Android
 Marshmallow and this is welcomed in a non-Nexus 
device.

This software recently got a series of updates and although the 
overall look and feel for it has remained the same, there are
 some tweaks hidden underneath. For example, the update
 has addressed a RAM management issue which means the
 phone now utilises more of the staggering 6GB of built-in 
RAM. This means apps can stay in the phone's memory for
 longer without having a dramatic impact on the 
performance of the phone.

As part of the Oxygen OS 3.2.6 update on September 20, OnePlus
 issued a series of bug fixes to improve camera quality, optimise
 white balance and improve 1080p video recording.

Elsewhere, the firm has optimised voice call quality of some IM
 apps, improved battery life when scrolling and boosting the
 touch accuracy when playing games.

One complaint is not being able to quickly find apps or services,
 although this is a general complaint about Android itself rather
 than OnePlus 3 in particular. We often struggled to find an
 app or a setting compared to our experience with the iPhone.

We also missed the Reachability feature seen on iOS. On such a
 large screen it was difficult to use the phone one-handed. Plus,
 the thin bezel made it difficult to reach our thumb into the far
 corners because our palm would select an app.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:verdana;font-size:400%;text-align:left;">            Performance</pre>
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">
Inside the phone is a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
 processor, up to 2.2 GHz, which is said to give the phone a 40
 per cent boost in graphical power, compared to the OnePlus 2,
 without impacting on the battery. It also features a 
industry-leading 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM to make the handset
 feel even faster. In particular, the power boosts have made
 it possible to increase the speed at which the new ceramic
 fingerprint sensor recognises a user.

There was a noticeable speed and accuracy increase between the
 iPhone 6 and 6S' fingerprint scanner and the same can be
 said for the OnePlus 3. OnePlus claims the sensor can 
respond in 0.2 seconds and while WIRED hasn't physically
 timed this, we can't argue with the figure. It happens
 in the blink of an eye.

Unlike the iPhone's home button that needs to be pressed to wake up
 the homescreen - and which can inadvertently unlock the device
 if a registered finger is used - the OnePlus 3 can be 'woken up'
 simply by tapping the display. Its fingerprint scanner is also
 touch-sensitive making it a smooth process when wanting to
 return to the homescreen from an app, for example. This 
adds to the overall high-end feel of the phone.

Other connectivity options include those seen on almost every
 other flagship, high-end smartphone. These are namely, 4G LTE,
 11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS.

Having spent a month with this touch-sensitive scanner, however,
 it can cause problems. Simply touching the button while
 removing the phone from a bag will unlock the device, 
and this led to apps opening, songs being changed and even 
calls being made by accident because the screen inadvertently
 unlocked.

The phone also vibrates to register when a fingerprint has
 been recognised or detected. This is a minor complaint, and
 can be disabled, but became irritating after a while.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:verdana;font-size:400%;text-align:left;">            Battery</pre>
<input name="" type="image" src="l6.jpg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
<pre style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">
To accompany the power boosts, the OnePlus 3 uses Dash Charge
 technology which the company describes as a "faster, cooler
 and safer way to charge a smartphone". Dash Charge
 replenishes more than 60 per cent of the 3,000 mAh battery
 in 30 minutes - and this was true in tests. It can also lower
 the temperature of the phone while charging by shifting
 the power management process from the phone itself to
 the Dash Charge adapter.

Over a 24-hour period of typical use, which included browsing
 the web, uploading a post to Facebook, scrolling through
 Twitter, responding to a selection of emails and playing
 Spotify for around four hours, battery levels hardly
 dropped. From 6pm last night, when the phone was
 on 100 per cent, to 5pm today the battery was on
 55 per cent and was showing one day and eight hours
 left. This is an incredible feat.

The longer we used the phone, though, the less time
 it seemed to last. The screen often used a large amount of
 battery even with the brightness dipped. A positive part
 of this drop was the fact that its battery life predictions 
appeared to 'learn' our behaviour to give an accurate
 reading. There is nothing worse than a phone 
claiming you have two hours left before dying 
30 minutes later.
